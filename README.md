This is just an example of a hypothetical site for a company that wants to advertise their products (in this case wines & co.).

A company that wants to have modern look ([Material Design](https://material.google.com) + [CSS3 Animations](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp)) and wants to support large number of devices and screen resolutions (responsive layout).

There are almost certainly some errors or things that should be done in some other ways. So forgive me and correct me if you want :)
